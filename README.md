# CalculatorJava

CALCULATOR: 

addition(): Takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.
subtraction(): Takes two numbers as input and returns the result of subtracting the second number from the first.
multiplication(): Takes two numbers as input and returns their product.
division(): Takes two numbers as input and returns the result of dividing the first number by the second.
power(): Takes two numbers as input and returns the result of raising the first number to the power of the second.
sqrt(): Takes a number as input and returns its square root.
mean(): Allows the user to input a series of numbers until they enter "end", then calculates and returns the mean (average) of those numbers.
variance()`: Allows the user to input a series of numbers, calculates the variance, and returns the result.

This code defines a `CalculatorMain` class with a `main` method, creating a menu-driven interface for performing mathematical operations using a `Calculator` instance. It repeatedly displays options for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, square root, mean, and variance calculations, executing the corresponding methods based on user input until the user chooses to exit.

INPUT_METHODS: 

This code defines an `Input` class with a method `input2Numbers()` that prompts the user to input two numbers and returns them as an array of doubles.

This code defines a class `InputMethodsMain` with a `main` method that provides a menu-driven interface for calculating factorials using various input methods such as command-line arguments, `Scanner`, `BufferedReader`, `DataInputStream`, and `Console`. It repeatedly displays a menu of input methods, prompting the user to choose one. Depending on the user's choice, it calculates the factorial of a number provided through the chosen input method. The program continues to run until the user chooses to exit.
