# CalculatorJava

addition(): Takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.
subtraction(): Takes two numbers as input and returns the result of subtracting the second number from the first.
multiplication(): Takes two numbers as input and returns their product.
division(): Takes two numbers as input and returns the result of dividing the first number by the second.
power(): Takes two numbers as input and returns the result of raising the first number to the power of the second.
sqrt(): Takes a number as input and returns its square root.
mean(): Allows the user to input a series of numbers until they enter "end", then calculates and returns the mean (average) of those numbers.
variance()`: Allows the user to input a series of numbers, calculates the variance, and returns the result.

This code defines a `CalculatorMain` class with a `main` method, creating a menu-driven interface for performing mathematical operations using a `Calculator` instance. It repeatedly displays options for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, square root, mean, and variance calculations, executing the corresponding methods based on user input until the user chooses to exit.
